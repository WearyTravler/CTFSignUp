# CTFSignUp: a CLI tool that displays the next top 10 CTFs based on the users criteria for which CTFs they want to compete in

## What do I want it to do?

- Let the User Sign-in to the respected CTF site
- Allow the User to check their Teams, Status, Users enrolled into the site
- Sign-up/Participate for the top 10 upcoming CTFs in regards to their selected criteria in which type of CTFs they want to participate in
- VERY CRAZY: 3rd party-sign up with same email used on site




## What sites do I currently want it to pull from?

`https://ctftime.org`
